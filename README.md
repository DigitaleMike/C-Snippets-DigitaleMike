## Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of several fundamental algorithms in C programming language, all within a single file. The algorithms included are:

### Linear Search
- The linear search algorithm searches for a target element in an array by iterating through each element until a match is found or the end of the array is reached.

### Binary Search
- The binary search algorithm searches for a target element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the target element is found or the search space is empty.

### Bubble Sort
- The bubble sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, resulting in larger elements "bubbling" to the end of the array in each iteration.

### Fibonacci using Dynamic Programming
- The Fibonacci algorithm calculates the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming. It builds an array of Fibonacci numbers iteratively, starting from the base cases, until it reaches the desired Fibonacci number.

All the algorithm implementations are provided in a single C file.

Please note that these implementations are for educational purposes and may not be the most optimized or efficient versions of the algorithms.
